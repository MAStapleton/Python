#Summary:

#Full-time students (67.16% graduation rate) significantly outperform part-time students (42.9%). 
#Gender disparities are evident, with female students (69.76% graduation rate) surpassing male students (43.99%). 
#Young adults (71.93% graduation rate) show higher completion rates compared to mature adults (39.41%) and adults (36.27%), 
#suggesting age-related challenges.
#Special applications yield the highest graduation rate (82.54%), 
#while transfer students (40.48%) and ordinance applicants (59.30%) lag behind. 
#Scholarship holders (86.17% graduation rate) excel, while students in debt (24.46%) and with delinquent tuition (5.97%) struggle, 
#emphasizing the impact of financial support on completion.
#Students with high school education or technical specializations graduate at rates close to the average (62.58% and 60.94%, 
#respectively), whereas those below high school graduation fare poorly (26.32%). 
#Parental occupation, particularly in technical specializations, correlates with lower graduation rates. 
#Occupations classified as "Other" show disproportionately low rates for both mothers (29.74%) and fathers (34.72%), 
#indicating socioeconomic barriers to completion.
